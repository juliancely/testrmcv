clean_up_tocs = In a Dual Landscape context, when an original transport request is released, if it contains objects with no conflict, a ToC is also generated for the automatic retrofit at the same time. This ToC is being released immediately and therefore cannot be changed. \n\nBefore an auto-import activity is executed during the retrofit, the categorization of data is checked again to ensure that the current conflict information is taken into account. This check could identify that an object previously without conflicts now presents a conflict. In that case the ToC previously generated is never used and pollute the import queue of the Development System of Project Branch. \n\nThe job (CLEAN_RETRO_TOC_<SYSTEM>~<CLIENT>) is cleaning obsolete Retrofit ToCs once a day.

This is called a potential subsequent downgrade situation. This kind of issue can be prevented by avoiding shifting changes and must be protected with Downgrade Protection (Predecessor Check).
shift_change_warning_3= As a matter of fact, if any predecessor Check was reported and ignored during import of a previous Release, setting the Change Document back to Change Released may lead to an effective downgrade when this Change Document will be imported. This has to be managed before the import. This kind of issue can be prevented by avoiding shifting changes and must be protected with Downgrade Protection (Imminent Downgrade).
